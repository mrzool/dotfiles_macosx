zool's dotfiles
===============

__Running two parallel config repos for Mac OS X and Linux was causing me all sort of headaches, so this repo is deprecated and no longer maintained. All my dotfiles are now in a single repo at https://github.com/mrzool/dotfiles__ 

Minimal config for Mac OS X.

This repo includes dotfiles for:

- bash
- git
- vim
- mr
- ack
